// All functions should use auth.isAdmin() middleware
// Note: First admin user should be manually added?

// Delete user -- deleting admins?

// Registration -- should only be performed by admins
    // We can have an admin portal for this
    // username, email, role (agent or admin)
    // sends email to user with page where they can input a password to create the account (expires after 1 hour -- can use cron job to clean this up)
